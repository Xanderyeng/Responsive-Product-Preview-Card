## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I achieved responsiveness by applying the box model concept to control the spacing, padding, and margins of elements. I also used flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts without having to use grid.

### Continued development

I would like to re-build this challenge using react library with Tailwind for styling and Svelte to compare.
